"""Wide tables for people, dashboards, and agents, plus the generated data dictionary.

marts/school_year     one row per school and school year (sy): who the school was that year,
                      and every school-level measure with an `all students` value that year
marts/school_profile  one row per school: identity, and for each measure the most recent
                      reported value and the school year (`<measure>_sy`) it is from

Only `reported` values are filled in; suppressed, waived, and other statuses are blank here, and
the long table core/school_metric keeps them with their status. Years differ by measure (a
facility score from 2022 sits beside attendance from 2025), so always read the `_sy` column
before comparing schools. These are facts, not rankings: there is no composite score.

Every column is described in schema/*.json and in the Parquet file metadata, generated from
registry/measures.csv (one source of truth), and docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md lists them all.
