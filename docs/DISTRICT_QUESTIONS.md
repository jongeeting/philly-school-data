# Questions for the School District

Open data gaps that someone at the district could close. Generated from [sources/gaps.csv](../sources/gaps.csv) (`district_question`); full entries are in [DATA_GAPS.md](DATA_GAPS.md).

1. **When a school closes or merges, does the district record which school(s) received its students (for example in Board resolutions or a closure crosswalk)? Is there a list for the 2013 closures?** (GAP-001, high priority)
   - Context: School lineage (predecessor/successor) table is empty: no source says which school absorbed a closed school's students
2. **Is there a building inventory that links school codes (ULCS) to buildings and OPA parcel numbers, including co-locations and annexes?** (GAP-013, high priority)
   - Context: No building table yet; schools are linked to City parcels (OPA account) by location, but not to buildings
3. **Does the district keep a history of canceled and late buses, or on-time performance by route? Could it be shared?** (GAP-021, high priority)
   - Context: Daily canceled or late bus list: no public history; capture started 2026-10-07 with psd snapshot-buses (needs a daily schedule)
4. **Could the facilities planning dashboard data (condition, program alignment, utilization, vulnerability scores, and recommendations) be published as a downloadable file?** (GAP-022, high priority)
   - Context: Facilities dashboard (scores for building condition, program alignment, utilization, neighborhood vulnerability, plus per-school recommendations) runs in a Qlik app with no export; scripted access is refused
5. **Which operational data exist internally but are not published: work order completion, bus on-time history, substitute fill rates, IEP evaluation timeliness?** (GAP-024, high priority)
   - Context: Maintenance work orders, bus on-time history, substitute fill rates, and IEP evaluation timeliness are not public
6. **Would the district confirm in writing that a public, attributed, openly licensed compilation of its open data sets is permitted under its Terms of Use (or agree to a short data-sharing note)?** (GAP-028, high priority)
   - Context: District Terms of Use restrict copying and limit use to governmental, accountability, and evaluative purposes; OpenDataPhilly lists the license as unspecified
7. **Have the minutes for the April 23 and April 30, 2026 Board meetings been approved and posted?** (GAP-037, high priority)
   - Context: Board minutes for the April 23 and April 30, 2026 meetings (the facilities plan vote) are not posted; the May 28 approval item has no attachment
8. **Can out-of-school suspension counts be published by disability (IEP) and English learner status, like the race and gender breakdowns?** (GAP-055, high priority)
   - Context: District suspension data has no disability (IEP) or English learner groups, so the paired 'suspension disparities by race and disability' release cannot be built from public files
9. **Can the district share its building inventory with building IDs, addresses, OPA numbers, and which school programs occupy each building?** (GAP-067, high priority)
   - Context: No building-level list from the district: which structures it owns or uses, their addresses, and which schools occupy each; buildings here are inferred from school lists and environmental and assessment records
10. **How are student withdrawals and re-enrollments recorded around the October 1 count, and were past years' counts affected by late re-enrollments or by withdrawals that were not processed?** (GAP-069, high priority)
   - Context: The October 1 enrollment count may include students re-enrolled just before the state funding deadline who had left earlier (Inquirer, 2026-10-06: about 720 re-added, about 2,000 improper withdrawals acknowledged); how withdrawals and re-enrollments are recorded is not published
11. **Can the district share school-level budget allotments, position counts, and actual spending by school and fiscal year as a data file?** (GAP-070, high priority)
   - Context: School-level budgets: allotment detail, purchase summaries, and position lines for FY16 to FY27 are loaded from the district's School Budgets tool; actual spending by school (versus budgets) is not published
12. **Can the district share the final school-by-school receiving assignments for the 2013 closures, and the SRC resolution of March 7, 2013?** (GAP-078, high priority)
   - Context: Final 2013 receiving schools for the closed schools: the press lists we have are the December 2012 proposal, which offered several choices per school and included schools later kept open
13. **Why do the 2019-20 to 2024-25 master lists include only 2 to 4 'Alternate Schools' when 2018-19 and 2025-26 list 25 to 28? Is there a fuller list for those years?** (GAP-006, medium priority)
   - Context: District master lists omit most Alternate Schools in 2020-2025 (2 to 4 programs vs 25 to 28 in 2019 and 2026)
14. **Has the district ever reassigned a retired ULCS code to a new school?** (GAP-008, medium priority)
   - Context: Unknown whether the district ever reassigns a retired ULCS code to a new school
15. **Is there a list of school opening and closing dates (or Board resolution dates) beyond the Year Opened / Year Closed fields?** (GAP-009, medium priority)
   - Context: Closure and opening dates come only from list presence; real-world dates are not recorded
16. **What changed in the August 2025 repost of the 2014-15 to 2018-19 enrollment files, beyond the new suppression rules?** (GAP-020, medium priority)
   - Context: Student groups under 20 are suppressed at source; enrollment files for 2014-15 to 2018-19 were reposted Aug 2025 under new suppression rules
17. **When will staff vacancies, the SPOTlight scorecard, and Pre-K sites be refreshed?** (GAP-025, medium priority)
   - Context: Staff vacancies (due Aug 2025), SPOTlight scorecard (due spring 2025), and Pre-K sites (due spring 2026) are past the district's promised refresh dates
18. **Are the Goals and Guardrails progress figures available as data rather than PDFs?** (GAP-026, medium priority)
   - Context: Goals and Guardrails results are PDFs, with targets reset in April 2024
19. **Can catchment retention be published by grade or level (ES, MS, HS), or with residence at a smaller geography than catchment?** (GAP-031, medium priority)
   - Context: Catchment retention (students by catchment and school, SY 2016-17 on) is aggregated by catchment, not neighborhood, and cannot show where students went after the 2013 closures
20. **Are the facility condition assessment reports after 2022 available, and is there a structured version of the condition scores?** (GAP-032, medium priority)
   - Context: Building condition reports (FCA): 2020-22 reports are PDFs on Google Drive (about 78), 2017 reports and 2018-19 AHERA survive only on the Wayback Machine; the 2022-24 facilities site's API data was never archived
21. **When will catchment boundaries for 2025-26 and 2026-27 be published?** (GAP-034, medium priority)
   - Context: Catchments for SY 2025-26 and 2026-27 are not published (latest is 2024-25)
22. **Does the district have the March 7, 2013 SRC school closure resolution and minutes?** (GAP-038, medium priority)
   - Context: The SRC's March 7, 2013 school closure resolution PDF is not archived (Wayback 404); no minutes found for that meeting
23. **The 2010-11 enrollment file reports zero Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and multiracial students in every school. Is a corrected file available?** (GAP-044, medium priority)
   - Context: The district's 2010-11 enrollment file reports zero Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and multiracial students in every school; those values are withheld
24. **Grades 3-8 PSSA proficiency fell about 8 points citywide between 2010-11 and 2011-12. Is there a district note on what changed that year (for example, testing procedures)?** (GAP-048, medium priority)
   - Context: District grades 3-8 proficiency fell about 8 points citywide between 2010-11 and 2011-12 (math 59.1% to 50.9%); the cause is not documented in the data files
25. **Serious incidents fell from 15,770 in 2012-13 to 6,579 in 2013-14. Did the reporting rules or categories change that year?** (GAP-056, medium priority)
   - Context: Serious incidents for 2012-13 total 15,770, 2.4 times the next year (6,579), with no explanation in the files
26. **How were referrals to law enforcement counted for the 2013-14 CRDC? It reports 94 referrals and 1,357 school-related arrests.** (GAP-062, medium priority)
   - Context: CRDC referrals to law enforcement are not comparable before 2015-16: 2013-14 reports 94 referrals but 1,357 school-related arrests (arrests are normally a subset); 2015-16 reports 6,834
27. **Which buildings does the lead-safe certification program cover, and is there a schedule for the rest?** (GAP-064, medium priority)
   - Context: Lead-safe assessments cover 163 schools; it is unclear whether every occupied building has one or which buildings are required to
28. **Can the catchment retention file include the student's grade, or the catchment level (elementary, middle, high) each student is counted under?** (GAP-082, medium priority)
   - Context: Catchment retention (flow) file has no grade or school level: it does not say which grades a student is in or whether they count toward their elementary, middle, or high catchment, so flows cannot be cut to a grade band (for example grades 7-12) and K-8 and 6-12 schools have to be split by rule
29. **How many students hold SEPTA student passes, by school, sector, and grade, and what share ride in a typical month?** (GAP-083, medium priority)
   - Context: No student transit pass data: how many students get SEPTA student passes, by school, sector (district, charter, non-public), and grade, and how often they ride, is not published
30. **Do alternative and contracted programs have NCES codes? About 25 per year have none in the master lists.** (GAP-004, low priority)
   - Context: NCES codes lost to scientific notation in CSV lists were repaired from xlsx where available or bridged from adjacent years; remaining blanks (about 25 per year in 2018, 2019, 2026, 2027) are programs with no NCES code in the source
31. **About 39 school-years in the master lists have no SRC School ID. Is that expected for those programs?** (GAP-005, low priority)
   - Context: Missing SRC school IDs (39 staged rows)
32. **Could Board meeting recordings be made downloadable or captioned, or shared for transcription?** (GAP-039, low priority)
   - Context: Board meeting video has no transcripts or captions and cannot be downloaded
33. **Is there a complete list of Board and SRC meeting videos (about 28 are not reachable from the player's listings)?** (GAP-042, low priority)
   - Context: 28 of 320 videos on the district TelVue player are not reachable from its listing pages (playlists show at most 50, no pagination); most are SRC meetings
34. **What was the ULCS code for Ombudsman South Transition (SRC 848, 2010-12)?** (GAP-045, low priority)
   - Context: Ombudsman South Transition (2010-11 and 2011-12) has an SRC school ID that maps to no ULCS code, so its enrollment is unassigned
35. **Is there a crosswalk between the serious incident types used through 2015-16 and the categories used from 2016-17?** (GAP-057, low priority)
   - Context: Serious incident categories changed in 2016-17 (fine-grained types before, grouped categories after); no published crosswalk between the schemes
36. **Was the 2011-12 CRDC submission complete for students with disabilities and English learners? It shows almost no repeat suspensions for IDEA students.** (GAP-061, low priority)
   - Context: CRDC 2011-12 discipline counts for students with disabilities and English learners look under-reported (almost no repeat suspensions reported for IDEA students; IDEA suspension rate equals the non-disabled rate, unlike every later year)
37. **Where are drinking water lead results for charter schools after 2019?** (GAP-063, low priority)
   - Context: Two 2019 water reports cover many charter schools in one table (Mastery, Renaissance charters) and are not read; charter water testing after 2019 is not in the district's folders
38. **Do 2023-2026 AHERA reports exist for the buildings whose latest posted report is from 2016 or 2019?** (GAP-065, low priority)
   - Context: AHERA reports before 2023 use an older layout; the latest report for 18 buildings is from 2016 or 2019, and 6 reports could not be read
